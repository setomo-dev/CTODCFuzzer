# CTODCFuzzer

## Installing

### Required system packages
- `docker`

### Build docker image
To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

First build baseline fuzzers and benchmarks.

```
./docker/build.sh
```

Then, build the all-in-one docker including `ctodcfuzzer` and all the fuzzers/benchmarks.

```
./build.sh
```

You can tune the image name/tag in these `build.sh`.

You might need to tune `_UID` and `GID` (they are hard-coded to `2000` when building the pre-built image) in `build.sh` to bypass docker volume permission issue if you don't want to use root user.

#### Build Note/Warning

The build script parallels the compilation process a lot by making the jobs runs in the background (by inserting `&` at the end of shell commands). It will takes a lot of CPU and RAM (especially during linking). Please remove `&` in build scripts (`build.sh` or `build_all.sh` under `docker/benchmark`) when you are building under less performant machines.

### Increase inotify limits
```sh
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```
To make it persistent between reboot; add the following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf` on the host.
```
fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```
